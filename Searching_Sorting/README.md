<h3>User-defined function basics</h3>

Basics of functions
A function is a named list of statements.<br>
A function definition consists of the new function's name and a block of statements. Ex: void PrintPizzaArea() { /* block of statements */ }.
A function call is an invocation of a function's name, causing the function's statements to execute.
The function's name can be any valid identifier. A block is a list of statements surrounded by braces.
