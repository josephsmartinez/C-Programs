<strong>Programming (general)</strong>
Computer program basics
Computer programs are abundant in many people's lives today, carrying out applications on smartphones, tablets, and laptops, powering businesses like Amazon and Netflix, helping cars drive and planes fly, and much more.

A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time. Basic instruction types are:

Input: A program gets data, perhaps from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.
Process: A program performs computations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.
Output: A program puts that data somewhere, such as to a file, screen, network, etc.

<code>
#include <stdio.h>

main(){
        printf("Hello world\n");
}
</code>
